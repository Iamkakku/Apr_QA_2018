WAIT IN SELENIUM:- 
Why we need wait? 
Selenium can handle the upcoming actions only when the element is fully loaded in the DOM.

Exception:- 
Element not found 
staleElementException

Wait two type:- (IQ)
Implicit wait :- 5 secs... check in the 0th sec if the element is found it will not wait if not found in 0th sec then waits completely for the time specified.. onece in that 20.
20 ---it apply for all element.
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlywait(20,TimeUnit.SECONDS);

Explicit wait:- it checks for 0th sec if element is found it will not wait. if not found then checks for every 500ms. until the specified time

Mouse hover:- 
Action Class---you can 
Action action= new Action(driver);
action.MoveToElement(element).perform(); // 

/ if sometime 2-3 actions together
// action.movetoElement(element).build().perfom();

Frame-
driver.switchTo.frame(Frame1);
driver.swithTo().defaultContent();


Alert:- (IQ)
different types of alerts: 
 it can be web based  and windows based.

note:- Selenium will not support windows based pop up
 Only Pop Up is web based you can use selenium .
For Web based popup
 Alert - interface 
Alert alert=driver.swithTo().alert();

alert.dismiss()
alert.accept()
alert.sendkeys("fkjhgfd")
getText()

for Windows based pop up 
1 Robot Class
it is seperate class in java.AWT which will allow us to perform multiple task .
 we can simulate keyborad event in selenium. 
you have to use methods of that class

keyPress()
keyRelease()

Robot r=new Robot();
r.KeyPress(KeyEvent.VK_ENTER);
r.KeyRelease(KeyEvent.VK_ENTER);

2 Auto it.
 $windowHandle=WinGetHandle("File Upload")
WinActivate($windowHandle)
ControlFocus("File Upload","","Edit")
ControlSetText("File Upload","","[Class:Edit;Instance:1]","C:\Users\16692\Pictures\Screenshots\1.jpg")
Sleep(2000)
ControlClick("File Upload","","[Class:Button;Instace:1]")
