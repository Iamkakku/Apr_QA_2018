What is SERVICE?
Service available over web.
communication between two or more web application.

We have two types of Web services.
SOAP:- Simple Object Access Protocol
                Medium - HTTP(POSt)
                 Format:- XML
                 heavy weight
 inbuilt security (w3c standard)
REST:- Representational State Transfer
           
               Medium - HTTP(POSt)
                 Format:- XML/JSON/TEXT
                   light  weight
 easy to understand
 implements some method to get security


WSDL :- Web Services Description Language. 

if you are consumer what you need to know
what are services available?
what are request and response parameters?
how to call that web services?

 service provider will publish doc that contains all attributes...interface-XML 
it describe the functionalities of webservices

UDDI - Universal Description , Discovery and Integration.


What  we have test in web services testing?
Functional testing, Security Testing, Load testing, status code , RESPONSE Message, content type, data types , repose data, valid invalid status.


SoapUI --TOOL - OPEN SOURCE-- SOAP  web services test--
now test REST request---

HTTP Methods:-(IQ)
POST-- TO CRETE RESOURCE
GET--TO RETRIEVE INFORMATION FROM RESOURCE 
PUT--- UPDATE RESOURCE
DELETE-- TO DELETE RESOURCE

Status code:-(IQ)
200- OK - success 
201- Created- POST, PUT
400- Bad Request-
404 - Page not found- 
405- Method not allowed- 
500- internal server error- 

https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html

Assertions:- comparison between Expected and actual output.
 
addition
 int a=20 
int b=10
 actual -30

answer:- expected op- 30


so if actual output and expected both are same so test case pass
 if actual output and expected both are not same so test case fail.

SOAP Project :-

project level -> test suite - test case- test steps

test suite- set of cases
test case - set of test steps..

 3 TYPES OF TESTING
FUNCTIONAL TETSING
LOAD TESTING
SECURITY TESTING

Assertion:- (IQ)
contains
not contains
invalid HTTP Status Code Assertions
valid HTTP StaTUS CODE


Data Source :- take input data from external file (excel,csv,txt)
Data Sink:- save your response in external file....
Data Gen:---to update data
